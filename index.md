I’m a PhD candidate in Linguistics at Stanford University, co-advised by Dan Jurafsky and Rob Podesva. My research bridges sociolinguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics to explore how language encodes social meaning and shapes bias in both humans and AI systems.

My dissertation examines how linguistic variation among Black drivers in Oakland—particularly features of African American Language—affects police behavior during traffic stops. I’m supported by the NSF GRFP and Stanford’s DARE, RAISE, and HAI-TEP Fellowships. Beyond Stanford, I’ve interned at Google Research, IBM Research, and the Brookings Institution, conducting research on LLM neutrality evaluation, bias in generative and embedding models, and AI policy for low-resource languages.
