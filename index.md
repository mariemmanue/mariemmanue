I’m a PhD candidate in Linguistics at Stanford University, co-advised by Dan Jurafsky and Rob Podesva. My research bridges sociolinguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics to examine how language encodes social meaning and shapes bias in both humans and AI systems.

My dissertation investigates how linguistic variation—particularly features of African American Language—influences police behavior during traffic stops. I’m supported by the NSF GRFP and Stanford’s DARE, RAISE, and HAI-TEP Fellowships. Beyond Stanford, I’ve worked at Google Research, IBM Research, and the Brookings Institution on LLM neutrality evaluation, model bias in generative and embedding systems, and AI policy research for low-resource languages.
